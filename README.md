# Student Data Management System
This is a project that simulates how CREATE, READ, UPDATE, and DELETE data on SQL work. It has two pages: one for users (students) and the other for admins.
On the user page, the user can only see the table and use the search bar to look for particular information.
On the admin page, the user can add, modify, and delete data about the student. This is my first try.

You can check the working page on the following link: (https://bananauniversity.free.nf/)
